This was a server side *mnemonic* password generator I created in highschool. The quality of the code is really poor but the app nonetheless does its job and you can check it out at [matilde.herokuapp.com](https://matilde.herokuapp.com).

Matilde generates passwords allowing you to save them in png format and in order to avoid recognition of these images by some OCR software it adds a bit of security using the [ZXX fonts](https://www.google.it/search?q=zxx+font).

# About

This app dates back to 2012 and in 2013 due to university I had no time to mantain it and the project was closed. This is a really buggy app and I reccommend you to not use it.

But hey, it was fun creating it back then!
