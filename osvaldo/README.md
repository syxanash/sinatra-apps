## Osvaldo

Osvaldo is just an attempt to play with [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/) Ruby framework. With Osvaldo I'd like to put into practice what I learned on Ruby MVC, thus please give me feedbacks if you really want to contribute to this project.

Osvaldo is crime, is cancer, is wrong, do not use it for real projects!

## Heroku app
